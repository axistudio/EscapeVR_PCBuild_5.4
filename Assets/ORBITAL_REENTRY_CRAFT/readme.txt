TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

- When you open the file for the first time the craft mesh will be bright blue(or potentially some other color). This is normal. The Substance material is generating textures. After a few seconds the textures will appear.

- If while modifying the the input on your substance parameters and the mesh turns yellow, something has gone wrong with Substance. Check and then uncheck the "Generate all outputs" checkbox. This will force the Substance material to regenerate all of the textures and return it to functioning normally.

- Substance WILL make Unity crash from time to time. Save often. The best way to avoid this is to not try to modify input parameter while the "generating" text is displayed while Substance is processing.


SOURCE TEXTURES:
----------------

4k versions of Baked Source textures are included with this asset for those who don't want to use Substance or are using a different shader setup such as Skyshop or Alloy.
